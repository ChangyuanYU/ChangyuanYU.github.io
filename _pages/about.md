I'm currently a Ph.D. student at the Microelectronics Thurst, Function Hub of the [HKUST(GZ)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/) advised by [Prof. Hongce Zhang](https://hongcezh.people.ust.hk/). Before that, I got my bachelor's degree at School of Microelectronics, Tianjin University under the supervision of [Prof. Feng Feng](http://faculty.tju.edu.cn/ff/en/index.htm). My research interest includes Formal Verification, Electronic Design Automation(EDA), Model Checking, and Machine Learning.
